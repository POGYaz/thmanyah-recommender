# üéß Thmanyah Recommender System

This project was developed as part of the **Thmanyah Data and AI Assignment**.  
It analyzes podcast listening behavior and builds a content-based recommendation system using Python.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Load and clean user, episode, and listening log data
- Analyze user engagement across categories, genders, and countries
- Build a simple recommender function based on user preferences
- Visualize key trends and share recommendations

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

1. **Data Cleaning & Merging**
   - Removed all sessions with 0-second durations
   - Merged all datasets on `user_id` and `episode_id`

2. **Behavior Analysis & Visualizations**
   - Top episode categories
   - Listening duration by gender
   - Episode count per user
   - Listening time by country

3. **Recommender System**
   - Function recommends 3 new episodes based on favorite category
   - Already-played episodes are excluded
   - Works with any user ID from the dataset

## üìä Questions from the Assignment (and Answers)

### 1. **Which episode categories are listened to the most?**

Estimated from the bar chart titled *Top Episode Categories*:

| Category      | Approx. Count |
|---------------|----------------|
| Society      | 29            |
| Sports    | 28            |
| News       | 13            |
| Religion      | 9             |
| Politics       | 4             |
| Technology       | 4             |

These categories had the highest listening frequency in the dataset.

### 2. **What is the difference in average listening time between males and females?**

From the *Average Listening Duration by Gender* bar chart:

| Gender  | Avg Duration (seconds) |
|---------|------------------------|
| Male    | ~620                   |
| Female  | ~900                   |

Males had slightly longer average listening durations than females.

### 3. **What is the average number of episodes a user listens to?**

The average number of unique episodes per user is:  
**`4.42 episodes/user`**

---

### 4. **What is one additional useful analysis for understanding user behavior? Why?**

> I added an analysis of **total listening time by country**.

Estimated Top Countries by Engagement:

| Country         | Total Listening (seconds) |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Jordan     | ~19,500                   |
| Morocco           | ~19,000                    |
| Saudi Arabia            | ~12,000                    |
| Egypt          | ~10,000                    |
| UAE          | ~6,000                    |

This shows where the most active listeners are and helps the team localize or prioritize based on region.
